Detailed Explanation of the Student Grades Application
Introduction:
This document provides a detailed breakdown of the code for the Student Grades Application. The application is a Python-based program that uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface, Pandas for handling CSV data, and FPDF for generating PDF reports. The application allows users to login, view student grades, and save reports in a PDF format. The program is structured with several functions that interact with each other to provide a seamless experience for the user.
1. Importing Required Libraries:
The application begins by importing necessary libraries which provide functionality for various features in the application.

    - ‘import os’: This module is used to interact with the operating system. It helps in checking if the CSV file exists 
      and creating it if necessary.
    - ‘import tkinter as tk’: Tkinter is the standard Python interface for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). 
      It is used to build the windows, buttons, and input fields in the application.
    - ‘from tkinter import messagebox, filedialog’: The ‘messagebox’ is used to display alerts or error messages to the user, 
      while ‘filedialog’ is used to prompt the user to select or save files on their computer.
    - ‘import pandas as pd’: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library. It is used here to read and manage the student data 
      stored in a CSV file.
    - ‘from fpdf import FPDF’: The ‘FPDF’ class from the ‘fpdf’ module is used to generate PDF files. The PDF reports are generated 
      from the data retrieved via searches in the application.
    - ‘import datetime’: The ‘datetime’ module provides classes for manipulating dates and times. It is used for logging user activity 
      with timestamps.
    
2. Global Variables:
The following global variables are defined to manage the login credentials and the path to the CSV file containing the student data.

    - ‘USERNAME’ = "a"`: This is the hardcoded username used for the login functionality.
    - ‘PASSWORD’ = "p"`: This is the hardcoded password used for login.
    - ‘file_path’ = "filename.csv"`: The path to the CSV file that holds the student grades data. If this file does not exist, it will be created.
    
3. Function: create_empty_csv(file_path):
This function ensures that the required CSV file exists. If the file doesn't exist, it will create one with predefined columns.

    - The function checks if the CSV file exists using ‘os.path.isfile(file_path)’. If it does not exist, a new file is created 
      with columns ‘['studentname', 'subjectname', 'semesterno', 'grade']’.
    - The empty DataFrame is saved as a CSV using ‘pandas.DataFrame.to_csv()’.
    - If the file exists, a message is printed indicating the use of the existing CSV file.
    
4. StudentGradesApp Class:
The `StudentGradesApp` class is the main class that handles the user interface and the functionality of the application.
4.1. Method: __init__(self, root):
The `__init__` method is the constructor of the `StudentGradesApp` class, which is responsible for initializing the application’s GUI.

    - ‘self.root = root’: The ‘root’ parameter represents the main Tkinter window, which is assigned to ‘self.root’.
    - ‘self.root.title("Login")’: Sets the title of the main window to "Login".
    - ‘self.root.geometry("400x300")’: Defines the size of the main window (400x300 pixels).
    - ‘self.root.configure(bg="#f0f4f7")’: Sets the background color of the main window to a light blue color.
    
4.2. Login Frame Setup:
The login page is created with a frame that contains input fields for the username and password, as well as a login button.

    - ‘login_frame = tk.Frame(root, bg="#e9f3fb", bd=2, relief="ridge")’: This creates a frame that will contain the widgets for the login form. 
      It has a light blue background, 2px border, and a ridge relief style.
    - ‘login_frame.pack(expand=True, padx=20, pady=20)’: This packs the frame into the root window with padding.
    - ‘self.username_entry = tk.Entry(...)’ and ‘self.password_entry = tk.Entry(...)’: These are input fields for the user to enter their username and password.
    - ‘login_button = tk.Button(...)’: This button triggers the login process by calling ‘self.login’ when clicked.
    
4.3. Method: login(self):
The `login` method handles the user input validation for username and password.

    - ‘username = self.username_entry.get()’: Retrieves the entered username.
    - ‘password = self.password_entry.get()’: Retrieves the entered password.
    - The method then checks if the entered credentials match the predefined ones. If they do, the dashboard is opened. If not, an error message is shown.
    
4.4. Dashboard Page:
After a successful login, the user is redirected to the dashboard page, which displays the total number of students.

    - ‘self.df = pd.read_csv(file_path)’: Reads the student data from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - ‘total_students = len(self.df['studentname'].unique())’: Counts the number of unique students by looking at the 'studentname' column.
    
4.5. Search Page:
The search page allows users to search for student grades based on the student's name and semester number.

    - ‘search_button = tk.Button(...)’: The search button calls the `search` method when clicked.
    - The method ‘search(self)’ searches the DataFrame for rows that match the user input for student name and semester number.
    - The search results are displayed in a table format within a scrollable frame.
    
4.6. Saving PDF Reports:
The user can save the search results as a PDF report. This functionality is handled by the ‘save_as_pdf’ method.

    - The ‘FPDF’ class is used to create a PDF document.
    - The method adds table headers and student grade information, then calculates the average grade and adds it to the PDF.
    - ‘save_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(...)’: Opens a file dialog for the user to select where to save the PDF.
    
Conclusion:
This document provided an in-depth look at how the Student Grades Application works. The application allows users to log in, search for grades, and save results in a PDF format. It uses Tkinter for the GUI, Pandas for data manipulation, and FPDF for PDF generation.
